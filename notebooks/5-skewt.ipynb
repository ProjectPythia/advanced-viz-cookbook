    "Let's start out by talking about the structural elements of a Skew-T plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temperature Lines** are drawn at an angle up from the x-axis and are where the name \"Skew-T\" comes from.\n",
    "2. **Pressure Lines** are horizontal from the y-axis, where pressure is plotted at a logarithmic scale.\n",
    "3. **Dry Adiabats**: are lines of constant potential temperature as hypotethical air with no moisture content rises isentropically (with constant entropy).\n",
    "4. **Moist Adiabats**: are lines of constant equivalent potential temperature - the change in temperature of fully saturated air as it rises, undergoing cooling due to adiabatic expansion.\n",
    "5. **Mixing Ratio Lines**: represent lines of constant mixing ratio, the mass of water vapor relative to the mass of dry air.\n",
    "\n",
    "On all those structural elements, Skew-T plots have two lines plotted on them, **air temperature** and **dew point**. In this notebook, we'll be plotting the air temperature in red and the dew point in blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Skew-T plots have **wind barbs**. These describe the wind speed and direction at different pressure levels and are plotted on the right side of the diagram.\n",

This is a wrapper around matplotlib's [`barbs`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.barbs.html#matplotlib.pyplot.barbs) method that applies the appropriate transformation and positions the barbs as expected for a Skew-T plot. Note that we only plot the wind barbs for pressure levels greater than 100 hPa. This is just to keep the wind barbs from extending off the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the elements we have added specifically, you can see that the `SkewT` object also added some of the structural elements we discussed previously. By default, `SkewT` adds the horizontal pressure and skewed temperature lines. "
